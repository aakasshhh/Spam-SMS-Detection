# Spam-SMS-Detection

 ## Description:
Spam SMS Detection using AIML is a machine learning project aimed at automatically identifying spam SMS messages. With the increasing prevalence of unwanted and potentially harmful SMS messages, the need for effective spam detection solutions has become more critical than ever.

## Features:

#### 1. Data Preprocessing:
 Clean and prepare SMS data for analysis by removing noise, tokenizing, and reducing words to their base form.

#### 2. Feature Engineering: 
Extract meaningful features from the text data using techniques like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and N-grams to capture important information.

#### 3. Model Training: 
Train machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, neural networks) on preprocessed data to learn patterns distinguishing spam from non-spam messages.

#### 4. Evaluation Metrics:
Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with visualization tools like confusion matrices.

#### 5. Data Visualization: 
Visualize data distribution, word frequencies, and model performance to gain insights and communicate results effectively.

#### 6. Deployment Options: 
Deploy the trained model as a standalone application, web service/API, or mobile app for real-time spam detection.

#### 7. Scalability and Performance: 
Design the solution to handle large volumes of SMS messages efficiently, ensuring real-time processing and resource optimization.
